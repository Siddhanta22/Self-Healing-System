🔧 **Self-Healing Database**
💡 An AI-powered system that doesn't just log errors—it understands them, explains them, and helps you fix them.
🚀 Overview
In today’s fast-paced development world, error logs alone aren’t enough. You need intelligence, speed, and self-recovery—and that’s exactly what this project delivers.

The Self-Healing Database Backend is a full-stack AI-driven error-handling system that reimagines how modern apps detect, understand, and recover from database failures.

Instead of simply printing errors to a terminal or storing them in a log file, this system uses LLMs (Large Language Models) and vector search to:

📌 Log meaningful metadata about every error

🤖 Generate natural language explanations and probable fixes

📣 Alert developers in real-time via Slack

💬 Let users chat with an AI assistant to dig deeper into recurring or unresolved issues

It’s like having a personal debugging assistant, available 24/7.

✨ **Why This Project?**
Traditional backend systems are reactive—they crash, log an error, and leave the debugging to you. This project flips the paradigm with a proactive, AI-augmented solution:

🧠 Understands the error context, not just the code

🔁 Learns from past incidents using vector search (FAISS)

💬 Provides an interactive chatbot for deeper exploration

🔔 Instantly informs your team through Slack alerts with smart suggestions

🧰 Seamlessly fits into existing development workflows using REST APIs and modular architecture

It’s not just about logging errors—it’s about healing your system intelligently.

🧑‍💻 Developer’s Note
This project is built with ❤️ and a learner’s mindset. The goal isn’t just to create a working app—but to understand every component deeply: from PostgreSQL locking to vector retrieval and LLM behavior. If you’re an aspiring backend engineer, ML developer, or just an automation enthusiast, this system shows what’s possible when traditional systems meet modern AI.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key
- Slack webhook (optional)

### Setup
1) **Create database and tables:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE self_healing_app;
\c self_healing_app;

CREATE TABLE employee (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE error_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  error_code TEXT,
  error_message TEXT,
  source TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

2) **Configure environment:**
```bash
# Create .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
