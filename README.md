🔧 **Self-Healing Database**
💡 An AI-powered system that doesn't just log errors—it understands them, explains them, and helps you fix them.
🚀 Overview
In today’s fast-paced development world, error logs alone aren’t enough. You need intelligence, speed, and self-recovery—and that’s exactly what this project delivers.

The Self-Healing Database Backend is a full-stack AI-driven error-handling system that reimagines how modern apps detect, understand, and recover from database failures.

Instead of simply printing errors to a terminal or storing them in a log file, this system uses LLMs (Large Language Models) and vector search to:

📌 Log meaningful metadata about every error

🤖 Generate natural language explanations and probable fixes

📣 Alert developers in real-time via Slack

💬 Let users chat with an AI assistant to dig deeper into recurring or unresolved issues

It’s like having a personal debugging assistant, available 24/7.

✨ **Why This Project?**
Traditional backend systems are reactive—they crash, log an error, and leave the debugging to you. This project flips the paradigm with a proactive, AI-augmented solution:

🧠 Understands the error context, not just the code

🔁 Learns from past incidents using vector search (FAISS)

💬 Provides an interactive chatbot for deeper exploration

🔔 Instantly informs your team through Slack alerts with smart suggestions

🧰 Seamlessly fits into existing development workflows using REST APIs and modular architecture

It’s not just about logging errors—it’s about healing your system intelligently.

🔍** Core Capabilities**
Feature	Description
🤖 AI-Powered Debugging	GPT-3.5 interprets and explains database errors
🧠 LangChain + FAISS Integration	Learns from past issues to identify similar ones
💾 Error Logging	Logs detailed error metadata to PostgreSQL
📡 Slack Notifications	Delivers real-time alerts with explanations
💬 Chatbot Interface	Users can ask follow-up questions or request help
🌐 Streamlit Dashboards	Simple UIs for both chatbot and data interaction

🧠 **Built With**
Backend: Flask, psycopg2, PostgreSQL

AI Stack: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, LangChain, FAISS

AI-enhanced DevOps monitoring systems

Smart assistant for backend error triage

Personal portfolio to showcase full-stack + AI integration skills

**Long-Term Enhancement Ideas**

🔌 Migrate from Streamlit to HTML/CSS frontend

🤖 Add memory-based chatbot (e.g., store chat history contextually)

📈 Add error analytics dashboard (count, trend, source)

☁️ Deploy backend on Render or Railway (easy Flask hosting)



🧑‍💻 Developer’s Note
This project is built with ❤️ and a learner’s mindset. The goal isn’t just to create a working app—but to understand every component deeply: from PostgreSQL locking to vector retrieval and LLM behavior. If you’re an aspiring backend engineer, ML developer, or just an automation enthusiast, this system shows what’s possible when traditional systems meet modern AI.
